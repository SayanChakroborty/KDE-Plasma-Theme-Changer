# KDE-Plasma-Theme-Toggle
Scripts to toggle KDE Plasma Global Theme between user chosen Light and Dark themes including Konsole ColorSchemes and GTK Themes

Change the theme names in the script "themes" and make all files (dark, light, themes, toggle) executable. Use "toggle" to automatically toggle between dark and light themes based on configurable preset time or directly run "dark" and "light" to change themes accordingly.
